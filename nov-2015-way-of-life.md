### ANASTROPHE

From:

<https://bible.org/seriespage/lesson-1-hope-and-holiness-hostile-world-1-peter-11-2-introduction>

> One of Peter's favorite words is the Greek word, anastrophe. He uses it six times in 1 Peter (1:15, 18; 2:12; 3:1, 2, 16) and twice in 2 Peter (2:7; 3:11). It is only used five other times in the entire New Testament. It means "way of life" or "behavior." The point is, as Christians our way of life, our conduct and behavior should stand out like a foreigner stands out in China. We're supposed to be different, as the King James translates 2:9, "a peculiar people." (You're probably thinking, "Yes, I've met many peculiar Christians!") But it doesn't mean weird, but distinct. Christians should stand out as godly people in a corrupt, ungodly world.

1 Peter 1:15, 1 Peter 1:18, 1 Peter 2:12, 1 Peter 3:1-2, 1 Peter 3:16, 2 Peter 2:7, 2 Peter 3:11

> I Peter 1:15: but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct,   
> I Peter 1:18: knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,  
> I Peter 2:12: Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.  
> I Peter 3:1: Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives-- 2: when they see your respectful and pure conduct.  
> I Peter 3:16: yet do it with gentleness and respect, having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.  
> II Peter 2:7: and if he rescued righteous Lot, greatly distressed by the sensual conduct of the wicked   
> II Peter 3:11: Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness,


How Then Shall We Live, 2 Peter 3:11-18

> II Peter 3:11: Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, 12: waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn! 13: But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.
>
> 3:14: Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these, be diligent to be found by him without spot or blemish, and at peace. 15: And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, 16: as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures. 17: You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability. 18: But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.

![Composed Way of Life](./nov-2015/201511102-composed-conduct.png)

Idea behind this study is to look at the way that Christian character is developed through attitributes

### Examples:

#### 1 Cor 13 - Love

Love:

- is patient and kind
- does not envy or boast
- is not arrogant or rude
- does not insist on its own way
- is not irritable or resentful
- does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth
- bears, believes, hopes, endures all things
- never ends

#### 2 Pet 1 - Effectiveness

See [Spiritual Framework - 2 Pet 1](../nt/2pe/framework-2pet1.md#spiritual-framework-2-pet-1)

2 Pet 1:5-8

For this very reason, make every effort to supplement

- your faith with virtue,
- and virtue with knowledge
- and knowledge with self-control
- and self-control with steadfastness
- and steadfastness with godliness
- and godliness with brotherly affection
- and brotherly affection with love.

8: For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they __keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.__

#### Gal 5 - A life led by the Holy Spirit

Gal 5:22-25

22: But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23: gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. 24: And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Galatians 5:25: If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.

Fruit of the Spirit is

- love,
- joy,
- peace,
- patience,
- kindness,
- goodness,
- faithfulness,
- gentleness,
- self-control;

> (24) Two viable variants exist at this place in the text: ἁγιότητι (hagiotēti, "holiness") vs. ἁπλότητι (haplotēti, "pure motives"). A confusion of letters could well have produced the variant (TCGNT 507): In uncial script the words would have been written agiothti and aplothti. This, however, does not explain which reading created the other. Overall ἁπλότητι, though largely a Western-Byzantine reading (א D F G M lat sy), is better suited to the context; it is also a Pauline word while ἁγιότης (hagiotēs) is not. It also best explains the rise of the other variants, πραότητι (praotēti, "gentleness") and {σπλάγχνοις} (splanchnois, "compassion"). On the other hand, the external evidence in favor of ἁγιότητι is extremely strong (Pא* A B C K P Ψ 0121 0243 33 81 1739 1881 al co). This diversity of mss provides excellent evidence for authenticity, but because of the internal evidence listed above, ἁπλότητι is to be preferred, albeit only slightly.

Utley

> "holiness" ...Bruce Metzger in A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, comments that the translation committee for the UBS3 preferred "simplicity" (haplotēti), but gave it a "D" rating, meaning a very high degree of doubt (p. 575). However, the UBS4 edition gives it a "B" rating, meaning almost certain (p. 612). This increased certainty comes from the fact that Paul uses the term "simplicity" in 11:3 (and the same term translated "liberality" in 8:2; 9:11,13), but never in any of his writings does he use hagiotēti.

NIV

#### eilikrineia - Sincerity

> 2 Corinthians 1:12 For our confidence is this, the testimony of our conscience, that with simplicity and _sincerity_ like that of God, and not with earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, we conducted (anestraphēmen | ἀνεστράφημεν | aor pass ind 1 pl) ourselves in the world, and all the more toward you.

Morphology: N-DF-S Strong's: 1505 Transliterated: eilikrineia Root: εἰλικρίνεια 1) purity, sincerity, ingenuousness

_Gloss:_ sincerity, the positive moral quality of purity (especially in motives), a fig. extension of an unadulterated or unmixed substance
_Definition:_ clearness, purity;, met. sincerity, integrity, ingenuousness, 1 Cor. 5:8; 2 Cor. 1:12; 2:17*


_(Ingenuous means innocent, artless, simple. A near synonym is naive. Its opposite is disingenuous, which means "giving a false impression of being honest and sincere.")_

> 1 Corinthians 5:8 So let us celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity (eilikrineias | εἰλικρινείας | gen sg fem) and truth.

#### Purity {#cor112-purity}

Some translations do not have "and purity"

NET note:

> tc Although most mss (א H Ψ 0121 0243 1739 1881 Ï) lack "and pure" (καὶ τῆς ἁγνότητος, kai th" Jagnothto"; Grk "and purity") several important and early witnesses (Ì א* B D F G 33 81 104 pc ar r co) retain these words. Their presence in such mss across such a wide geographical distribution argues for their authenticity. The omission from the majority of mss can be explained by haplography, since the -τητος ending of ἁγνότητος is identical to the ending of ἁπλότητος (Japlothto", "sincerity") three words back (ἁπλότητος καὶ τῆς ἁγνότητος); further, since the meanings of "sincerity" and "purity" are similar they might seem redundant. A copyist would scarcely notice the omission because Paul's statement still makes sense without "and from purity."

> 1 Cor 4:16 I encourage you, then, be imitators of me.
>
> 1 Cor 11:1 Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ. 2 I praise you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions just as I passed them on to you.
>
> Phil 3:17 Be imitators of me, brothers and sisters, and watch carefully those who are living this way, just as you have us as an example.
>
> Phil 4:9 And what you learned and received and heard and saw in me, do these things. And the God of peace will be with you
>
> 1 Thess 1:6 And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, when you received the message with joy that comes from the Holy Spirit, despite great affliction.
>
> 2 Thess 3:7 For you know yourselves how you must imitate us, because we did not behave without discipline among you,
>
> 2 Thess 3:9 It was not because we do not have that right, but to give ourselves as an example for you to imitate

Here - specifically imitate faith - look at what is produced in the lives of those who (bring/brought) the gospel to me, see the blessings of God in their lives because of their faithfulness, and resolve to imitate that faithfulness.

### James 3:13 {#jms313}

> Who is wise and understanding among you? By his exemplary conduct (anastrophēs | ἀναστροφῆς | gen sg fem) let him show his works done in the gentleness born of wisdom.

#### Context (NET):

> 13 Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct he should show his works done in the gentleness that wisdom brings. 14 But if you have bitter jealousy and selfishness in your hearts, do not boast and tell lies against the truth. 15 Such wisdom does not come from above but is earthly, natural, demonic. 16 For where there is jealousy and selfishness, there is disorder and every evil practice. 17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, accommodating, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, and not hypocritical. 18 And the fruit that consists of righteousness is planted in peace among those who make peace.

First impression: someone who is "wise and understanding" manifests (through his ANASTROPHE) deeds that are characterized by gentleness.

Contrasted with jealousy and selfishness in James - gentleness means that I am humble and not self-serving in my interactions.  My "conduct" shows a non-reactionary approach to confrontation: I am not out to prove my point and be vindicated, but out to gently nurture others into the image og Christ.
